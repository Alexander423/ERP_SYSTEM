## Issue 1: Account Lockout Coordination Enhancement
**Title:** `Implement Redis-based Account Lockout Coordination`
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `security`, `priority-high`
**Description:**
```markdown
## Overview
Enhance the current account lockout mechanism with Redis-based coordination to prevent race conditions in distributed environments.

- [ ] Coordination across multiple application instances
- [ ] Prevent race conditions in concurrent login attempts
- [ ] Maintain current security standards

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Account lockouts work correctly in multi-instance setup
- [ ] No race conditions during concurrent failed login attempts
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 5ms overhead)
- [ ] Full backward compatibility maintained

## Technical Notes
- Use Redis SETNX/EXPIRE for distributed locks
- Implement lock timeout mechanisms
- Add comprehensive testing for concurrent scenarios
