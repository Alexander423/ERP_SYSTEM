-- Migration to add missing performance metrics and security columns
-- This fixes the remaining database schema mismatches

-- Add missing performance metrics columns to customer queries
-- These are typically computed from other tables, but we need placeholders for SQLX

-- For customer performance metrics (computed fields)
-- These would typically be calculated from orders, payments, etc.
-- Adding as optional fields that can be computed by business logic

-- Customer behavioral data columns
-- Most of these are JSON aggregates that would be computed

-- Security module missing columns

-- Add missing columns to user_roles table
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS user_roles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS assigned_by UUID,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS assigned_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW();

-- Add missing columns to roles table
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS roles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_system_role BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS description TEXT;

-- Add missing columns to role_permissions table
ALTER TABLE IF EXISTS role_permissions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS resource_type VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS conditions JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Add data masking exemptions column
-- Create table if it doesn't exist for data masking
