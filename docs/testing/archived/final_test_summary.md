### **2. Core Functionality Tests (✅ Verified Working)**

#### **Customer Validation Tests:**
```rust
✅ Customer number format validation (CUST-001, TEST-123, etc.)
✅ Email format validation (test@example.com, validation rules)
✅ Phone number validation (international formats, US formats)
✅ Legal name validation (length limits, content validation)
✅ Tags validation (duplicates, limits, format checking)
```

#### **Data Model Tests:**
```rust
✅ Customer creation with all required fields
✅ Address creation and validation
✅ Contact information handling
✅ Financial information processing
✅ Performance metrics tracking
✅ Customer request/response models
```

#### **Business Logic Tests:**
```rust
✅ Customer lifecycle stage transitions

✅ Customer type enumeration handling
✅ Multi-tenant data isolation
✅ Audit trail creation
```

### **3. Enterprise Security Framework**

#### **Security Modules Implemented:**
- **Field-Level Encryption** - AES-256-GCM with proper nonce handling
- **Role-Based Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions with time restrictions
- **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive security event tracking
- **Data Masking** - Privacy protection with role-based exemptions
- **Compliance Management** - GDPR, SOX, HIPAA validation frameworks

#### **Security Test Coverage:**
- Encryption/decryption validation
- Access control permission checking
- Audit trail generation and querying
- Data masking with user role exemptions
- SQL injection protection
- Concurrent access safety

### **4. Performance Testing Framework**

#### **Performance Benchmarks Established:**
- **Customer Creation**: < 10ms per customer average
- **Search Operations**: < 100ms with large datasets (1000+ records)
- **Concurrent Reads**: < 10ms average response time
- **Concurrent Writes**: < 50ms average with 95%+ success rate
- **Analytics**: Customer insights < 500ms, segmentation < 2 seconds
- **Event Store**: High-volume event processing capabilities

#### **Scalability Tests:**
- Bulk customer creation (100+ customers)
- Large dataset search performance
- Concurrent operation handling (50+ simultaneous operations)
- Memory usage optimization
- Database connection pooling

### **5. Advanced Features Tested**

#### **Event Sourcing Architecture:**
- Customer event generation and storage
- Event replay capabilities
- Aggregate state reconstruction
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Event versioning and migration

#### **Real-Time Analytics:**
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation
- Churn probability modeling
- Customer segmentation algorithms
- Behavioral pattern analysis
- Performance metrics tracking

#### **Advanced Search Capabilities:**
- Full-text search with PostgreSQL
- Multi-criteria filtering
- Semantic search with synonyms
- Customer similarity analysis
- Pagination and sorting

### **6. Compilation and Dependency Management**

#### **Dependencies Successfully Added:**
```toml
✅ aes-gcm = "0.10" (Field-level encryption)
✅ base64 = "0.22" (Encoding/decoding)
✅ sha2 = "0.10" (Hash functions)
✅ regex = "1.0" (Pattern matching)
✅ once_cell = "1.0" (Lazy statics)
✅ ipnetwork = "0.20" (IP address handling)
✅ futures-util = "0.3" (Async utilities)
✅ rand = "0.8" (Random number generation for tests)
```

#### **Type System Improvements:**
```rust
✅ Added Hash + Eq derives to security enums
✅ Fixed Decimal to f64 conversions in performance metrics
✅ Resolved String vs &str type mismatches
✅ Fixed async function signatures in tests
✅ Corrected DateTime method calls
```

### **7. Database Schema Enhancements**

#### **Missing Columns Added:**
```sql
✅ communication_preferences JSONB (Customer communication settings)
✅ priority SMALLINT (Role priority ordering)
✅ exemptions JSONB (Data masking exemptions)
✅ remediation_actions table (Compliance tracking)
✅ Additional security and audit columns
```

### **8. Test Execution Results**

#### **Working Test Categories:**
1. **✅ Core Validation Tests** - All basic validation logic working
2. **✅ Data Model Tests** - Customer, Address, Contact creation
3. **✅ Business Logic Tests** - Lifecycle, credit limits, enums
4. **✅ Type System Tests** - All custom types and conversions
5. **✅ Security Framework** - Encryption, access control architecture

#### **Integration Test Status:**
